## Trees
Trees are hierarchical data structures with parent-child relationships.
They consist of a root node and multiple levels of child nodes.
Trees are used to represent structured data like file systems.
Traversal techniques help access tree elements efficiently.

## Binary Search Trees
Binary Search Trees maintain data in a sorted hierarchical order.
Left subtree contains smaller values, right subtree contains larger values.
They allow efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.
Balanced trees provide better performance.
