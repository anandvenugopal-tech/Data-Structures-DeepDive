# Data Structures From Scratch

> “What I cannot build, I do not understand.” — Richard Feynman

This repository contains core data structure implementations built completely from scratch using Python, withoutrelying on high-level built-in data structure libraries.
The goal is to deeply understand how data structures work internally, rather than just knowing how to use them
